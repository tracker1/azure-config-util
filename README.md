# azure-config-util

***NOW SHOWING VERSION 2.x DOCUMENTATION - UNDER DEVELOPMENT - NOT IN NPM***

This library will use an Azure Table in order to generate/cache/refresh configuration objects.  This library does *NOT* encrypt line item configuration records.  Version 3 will add encrypted values, as well as command-line utilities for backing up and restoring config table values.


## Installation

```
npm install --save azure-config-util
```

## Usage

Configuration values will be determined and deconstructed from a [configured table](https://github.com/tracker1/azure-config-util/wiki/ConfigurationTable), using [specified configuration options and/or environment variables](https://github.com/tracker1/azure-config-util/wiki/ConfigurationOptions).

The behavior changes from 0.x-1.x in that it will now return a wrapper, and not a resolver/promise method for configuration.

```js
// You need to run the method the module returns to create a configuration fetcher
var azureUtil = require('azure-config-util')(configOptions);
```

## Instance Methods

The current utility methods/wrappers are those that I have needed either for configuration directly, or for use with Azure services.  I welcome other optional dependencies and related wrappers/methods for other libraries.

### Configuration

The configuration object resolution is the basis of this module, all other methods use the configuration to determine connection parameters.

* [.config()](https://github.com/tracker1/azure-config-util/wiki/GetConfigurationMethod)
  * Promise resolves to current configuration object (caching)

### Azure Storage

In order to better utilize azure storage, the following utility methods are written in order to access [azure-storage-simple](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azure-storage-simple) wrappers.

* [.storage(name)](https://github.com/tracker1/azure-config-util/wiki/GetStorageMethod)
  * Promise resolves to named Azure Storage wrapper
* [.blob(name)](https://github.com/tracker1/azure-config-util/wiki/GetBlobMethod)
  * Promise resolves to named Azure Storage Container wrapper
* [.queue(name)](https://github.com/tracker1/azure-config-util/wiki/GetQueueMethod)
  * Promise resolves to named Azure Storage Queue wrapper
* [.table(name)](https://github.com/tracker1/azure-config-util/wiki/GetTableMethod/)
  * Promise resolves to named Azure Storage Table wrapper

### Azure SQL & Microsoft SQL

You must `npm install` [mssql-ng](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mssql-ng) and [mssql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mssql) separately from this module.


* [.sql(name)](https://github.com/tracker1/azure-config-util/wiki/GetSqlMethod)
  * Promise resolves to named [mssql-ng](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mssql-ng) connection.


### ElasticSearch (Coming Soon)

You must `npm install` [elasticsearch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elasticsearch) separately.

* .es.client(keyName)
  * Will return a configured elasticsearch client.
    * Section: `elasticsearch`
    * Key: *elasticsearchKeyName*
    * JsonValue: Options used for an elasticsearch client, including hosts.
* .es.index(indexKeyName)
  * Will return a simple wrapper for elasticsearch.
    * Section: `esindex`
    * Key: *esindexKeyName*
    * JsonValue: `{server:elasticsearchKeyName},index:String,type:String}`
      * server: used with getEsClient(elasticsearchKeyName)

### Other Libraries

Other libraries should ideally implement connection pooling (as needed), and/or use [repromise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/repromise) to implement a retry mechanism.  Not to mention preference to a promises based implementation.

SQL database libraries (mysql, postrgresql, etc), should ideally be wrapped with something similar the the `mssql-ng` wrapper to provide template processing, and promise based results, and transparent connection pooling.


## Configuration Data

For now, it's best to use [Azure Storage Explorer](http://www.cerebrata.com/products/azure-explorer/introduction) (*screenshot below*) to edit your configuration values directly.
